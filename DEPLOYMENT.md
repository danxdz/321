### 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test the deployed app** - Make sure everything works
2. **Set up custom domain** (optional)
3. **Configure AI environment variables** (for photo-to-pop features)
4. **Set up form handling** (when you add backend)

### 🤖 AI Features Setup

To enable the photo-to-pop AI features, you need to configure environment variables in Netlify:

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard** → Your Site → Site Settings → Environment Variables
2. **Add the following variables:**

```bash
# Hugging Face Token (Required for AI features)
VITE_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here

# Optional: Replicate Token (for advanced 3D generation)
VITE_REPLICATE_TOKEN=your_replicate_token_here
```

**How to get tokens:**
- **Hugging Face**: Visit [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
- **Replicate**: Visit [https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens)

**Without tokens:** The app will work in simulation mode with canvas-generated pop characters.

### 🧪 **Test Auto-Deploy**

After initial deployment, test the auto-deploy:

1. **Make a small change** to your app (e.g., update text in `apps/web/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`)
2. **Commit and push** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test auto-deploy"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Check Netlify dashboard** - you should see a new build starting automatically
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the build to complete
5. **Visit your site** - changes should be live! 🎉

### 📊 **Build Status**

You can monitor builds in:
- **Netlify Dashboard**: Real-time build logs and status
- **GitHub**: Commit status checks
- **Email notifications**: Build success/failure alerts

---

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check the build logs in Netlify dashboard
2. Make sure `apps/web/package.json` has all dependencies
3. Verify `netlify.toml` configuration
4. Check that `apps/web/dist` folder exists after build

**If the app doesn't load:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all assets are loading
3. Check if redirects are working for SPA routing
