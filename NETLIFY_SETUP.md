## 🌐 Cloud Storage Setup (Optional but Recommended)

Since Netlify only hosts static sites, you can't run a backend server there. But you can use **free cloud storage** services:

### Option 1: ImgBB (Easiest - No Account Needed) 🎯

1. **Get API Key** (30 seconds):
   - Visit: https://api.imgbb.com/
   - Click "Get API Key"
   - Copy the key

2. **Add to Netlify**:
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add: `VITE_IMGBB_API_KEY = your_key_here`
   - Redeploy your site

**That's it!** Your images will now upload to ImgBB automatically.

### Option 2: Cloudinary (More Features)

1. **Sign up** at https://cloudinary.com/ (free tier)
2. **Get credentials** from Dashboard
3. **Create unsigned preset**:
   - Settings → Upload → Upload Presets
   - Add upload preset → Unsigned
   - Copy preset name

4. **Add to Netlify**:
   ```
   VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = your_cloud_name
   VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET = your_preset
   ```

## 📝 Environment Variables for Netlify

Add these in **Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables**:

```bash
# Required for AI features
VITE_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token

# Optional - Choose one for cloud storage
VITE_IMGBB_API_KEY=your_imgbb_key
# OR
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_preset
```

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **User uploads photo** → Loading spinner shows, buttons disabled
2. **AI analyzes photo** → Detects age, gender, features
3. **User selects class** → Character equipment changes
4. **Character generated** → Saved to:
   - **localStorage** (always, instant)
   - **Cloud storage** (if configured, permanent)
   - **Backend server** (if running locally)

---

## 💾 Storage Fallback Chain

The app intelligently tries multiple storage options:

1. **ImgBB** (if API key configured)
2. **Cloudinary** (if credentials configured)  
3. **localStorage** (always works, limited space)
4. **Backend server** (for local development)

This ensures your app **always works**, even without cloud storage!

---

## 🎮 Testing Your Deployment

1. **Visit your Netlify site**
2. **Upload a photo** - Watch for loading spinner
3. **Select different classes** - Character should change
4. **Save character** - Check browser console for storage location
5. **View gallery** - Characters persist between sessions

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images not uploading to cloud?
- Check environment variables in Netlify
- Look at browser console for errors
- Images still save locally as fallback

### Class selection not working?
- Clear browser cache
- Check console for errors
- Make sure you're on latest deployment

### Loading spinner stuck?
- Photo analysis takes 2-3 seconds
- Check browser console for errors
- Refresh and try again

## 📊 What's Stored Where

| Data | Location | Persistence |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Character data | localStorage | Until cleared |
| Original photos | Not stored | Privacy! |
| Generated characters | Cloud/localStorage | Permanent/Semi |
| Character metadata | localStorage | Until cleared |

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Photos are analyzed locally** (Canvas API)
- **Original photos are NOT uploaded** anywhere
- **Only generated characters** are saved
- **No personal data** sent to external services
- **All storage is optional** - works offline!

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>
cd happytracker
cd apps/web
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Add .env.local for local testing
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your keys
